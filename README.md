Key Features:

Data Collection and Understanding: The project commenced with the collection and import of HR data into the chosen data analysis tools, MS Excel and Power BI. The dataset likely encompassed various HR-related information

Dashboard Development: To present the findings in a user-friendly and visually engaging manner, an HR Analytics Dashboard was created using Power BI. Power BI allows for more advanced data visualization and interactivity compared to MS Excel. The dashboard included various charts, graphs, and tables to visualize key HR metrics and trends. It aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of HR performance and insights.

Recommendations: The final phase of the project involved deriving actionable conclusions from the analysis and providing recommendations to HR leadership. These recommendations could encompass strategies for improving recruitment, training, diversity and inclusion efforts, or any other HR-related aspect based on the insights gained from the data.

Tools Used:

MS Excel: Microsoft Excel played a role in data preprocessing, cleaning, and initial analysis. It was used to prepare the data for more advanced visualizations in Power BI.

Power BI: Power BI is a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool that was utilized to create the HR Analytics Dashboard. Power BI allowed for the creation of interactive and visually compelling dashboards that could be shared with stakeholders for informed decision-making.

In summary, the HR Analytics Dashboard project aimed to leverage HR data for insights and recommendations in support of HR-related decisions and strategies. MS Excel and Power BI were key tools in data analysis, visualization, and dashboard development, contributing to the HR department's data-driven objectives
